#theses code will probably not work, but it's alright, their purpose is not to be executed




#First thing I learn is using numbers and basic operators

    4+5 #will print 9
    10%3 #will print 1
    4+5*3-4/2+6464646/23+2 #will print something I don't need to know :D
    n/n #to print full div in n.nn ( n is for number )
    n//n # to only print the integer of the division




#Next is variables
    
    age=1
    #input age on python will get me 1
    age +=1 #add 1 to age
    age = 2 * 3 #basics
    int #for integer ( ...3, 4, 5... )
    float #for decimals ( ex : 3.5 )

#strings    

    string="string is actually a string"
    string="what's a string"
    string='It\'s a string boi.' #\to escape ' or " or \ itself
    string="I'm not under myself\nI'm not under myself now but under myself from another timeline" 
    string="""This i how i get 
    down
    and down
    and down
    without using \\"""
    a,b = b,a #will switch them
    a = b = c = 1 #a b c will be set to 1




#Functions

    type(a) #print the type of variable it is
    type("gnugnugnu") #print str, doesn't need to be a var in the ()
    
    print("a=", a) #the same logic as C, will print : a = "value of a"
    print("a is", a,"b is", b)
#I've learned how to print Hello world hihihi
